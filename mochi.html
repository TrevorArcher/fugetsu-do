      <h1>What is Mochi?</h1>
      <p>Mochi is a Japanese confection, found usually in the shape of a small, round rice cake which can be eaten with condiments such as kinako (roastedsoy bean flour), manju (sweet red bean paste), soy sauce dip, and seaweed. Traditionally, mochi is made by pounding steamed glutinous rice in a large wooden mortar, called the usu, with a wooden mallet called the kine. Mochi-tsuki is the Japanese term for the old-style method of pounding the steamed glutinous rice used to make mochi.</p>
      <p>The sticky dense mounds of rice are made from mochigome, a sweeter stickier type of rice, different from the steamed rice eaten every day.  Mochi was originally made as offereings to kami (gods) at shrines.  This offering was then cut into small pieces and given to people for good health and fortune.  Later, the mochi came to be eaten on various festive occasions and during the Heian Era (794-1192), it became an integral part of the New Year.</p>
